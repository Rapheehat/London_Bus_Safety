# London Bus Safety Performance Analysis

## Introduction

The safety of public transportation, particularly buses, is a critical concern in major cities like London. Analyzing bus safety performance helps in identifying areas where safety measures can be improved to prevent incidents and ensure the well-being of passengers and pedestrians. In the era of data-driven decision-making, leveraging SQL provides valuable insights into safety trends and helps in making informed decisions.

## Overview

This project is focused on analyzing the **London Bus Safety Performance** dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/darrylljk/london-bus-safety-performance). The main goal of this project is to demonstrate my skills in SQL by exploring, cleaning, and analyzing the data, extracting meaningful insights, and showcasing my ability to work with real-world data.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information related to bus safety performance in London, including details on incidents, bus operators, and boroughs. It provides a rich source of data for analyzing safety trends and identifying areas for improvement.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Exploration**: Understanding the structure of the dataset and identifying key trends.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and any data inconsistencies.
- **SQL Queries**: Writing SQL queries to perform various analyses.

## Conclusion

This analysis of the London Bus Safety Performance dataset showcases my ability to leverage SQL for in-depth data exploration and insights. Through various SQL techniquesâ€”such as aggregations, JOINs, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and Sub-Queriesâ€”I was able to delve into the complexities of bus safety data and reveal significant patterns.
The project demonstrated how SQL can be utilized to address real-world challenges by identifying key trends in incident frequency, severity, and geographical distribution. The findings not only highlight areas where safety improvements are needed but also offer actionable insights for stakeholders to enhance bus safety protocols.
This project underscores my proficiency in SQL and my capability to apply analytical skills to complex datasets, ultimately contributing to more effective safety measures and strategies.

Thank you for exploring this analysis! ðŸ˜Š
