# London Bus Safety Performance Analysis

## Introduction

The safety of public transportation, particularly buses, is a critical concern in major cities like London. Analyzing bus safety performance helps in identifying areas where safety measures can be improved to prevent incidents and ensure the well-being of passengers and pedestrians. In the era of data-driven decision-making, leveraging SQL provides valuable insights into safety trends and helps in making informed decisions.

## Overview

This project is focused on analyzing the **London Bus Safety Performance** dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/darrylljk/london-bus-safety-performance). The main goal of this project is to demonstrate my skills in SQL by exploring, cleaning, and analyzing the data, extracting meaningful insights, and showcasing my ability to work with real-world data.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information related to bus safety performance in London, including details on incidents, bus operators, and boroughs. It provides a rich source of data for analyzing safety trends and identifying areas for improvement.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Exploration**: Understanding the structure of the dataset and identifying key trends.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and any data inconsistencies.
- **SQL Queries**: Writing SQL queries to perform various analyses.

## QUESTIONS

**Q1. WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON TYPES OF INCIDENTS?**  
Identifying the types of incidents that occur most frequently allows for targeted prevention strategies.

**Q2. WHAT IS THE DISTRIBUTION OF INCIDENTS BY BOROUGH?**  
The data shows which London boroughs have a higher frequency of bus-related incidents, highlighting areas that may require more stringent safety measures.

**Q3. WHICH BUS OPERATORS HAVE THE MOST INCIDENTS?**  
Identifying the bus operators with the highest number of incidents can help in targeting safety improvements and training for specific operators.

**Q4. WHAT ARE THE COMMON SEVERITY LEVELS OF INCIDENTS?**  
Understanding the severity of incidents allows us to prioritize safety measures based on the potential harm caused by these incidents.

**Q5. HOW DO INCIDENT RATES VARY BY DAY OF THE WEEK?**  
Analyzing the data by days of the week helps in identifying patterns, such as whether certain days are more prone to incidents, which could be due to factors like traffic volume or operator fatigue.

**Q6. WHICH BOROUGHS EXPERIENCE THE MOST SEVERE INCIDENTS?**  
This analysis shows which areas not only have frequent incidents but also have more severe incidents, emphasizing the need for focused safety interventions.

**Q7. IS THERE A SEASONAL TREND IN INCIDENTS?**  
Understanding whether certain times of the year see more incidents can help in preparing for these periods with enhanced safety measures.

**Q8. HOW MANY INCIDENTS WERE RECORDED EACH YEAR?**  
The analysis reveals that certain years had a higher number of incidents, allowing us to identify trends over time and focus on years with increased safety concerns.

**Q9. WHAT IS THE AVERAGE TIME OF DAY FOR INCIDENTS?**  
This analysis can reveal if there are peak times during the day when incidents are more likely to occur, informing decisions about staffing and bus scheduling.

**Q10. HOW HAVE INCIDENTS CHANGED OVER TIME?**  
By analyzing changes in incidents over time, we can determine if safety measures implemented in the past have been effective or if new strategies are needed.

## Conclusion

The exploratory analysis conducted above serves as a testament to my expertise in utilizing SQL for data analysis. Throughout the analysis, I employed a range of techniques including aggregations, JOINs, CTEs, and Sub-Queries to extract valuable insights from the data. By leveraging these advanced SQL functionalities, I was able to uncover hidden patterns, establish connections between different data sets, and derive meaningful conclusions. This demonstrated my ability to employ diverse analytical approaches and showcase the full potential of SQL for in-depth data analysis.
